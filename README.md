## Wireframes

I have drawn up a few designs for how I wanted to build the website. I wanted it to look sharp and easy to use, with clear navigation available at every part of the site.

## Overview

This is a Fantasy genre App for an aspiring guild to host content about their inception and progress. The concept behind it is for friends and family of the guild to be able to see progress of the guild through the use of updated content for missions, general news and recruited personnel updates. The missions the guild participate in are a great way to discover and procure resources, which upon inspection by the research and science team can either be bred or created for purchase by other users of the site.

As more missions are undertaken by the guild, the list of content will increase for views to see the progress of the growing guild and and what their daily/weekly activities are. They will also have more resources to sell as they discover new subtances, fabrics, food and materials.

## User Stories

The main purpose of this site is for a group of adventurers and and researchers establishing a base to be able to blog and post updates, recruit new members and keep track of the activities take on by the league. There are specific users that have the ability to update and add content such as missions, news, personnel and resources to teh site to keep the content up and running.

Upon visiting the site with superuser access they can see any of the content that has been uploaded and review it, edit it or even delete it if you dont want it to approve. Upon subsequent visits to the site, they will see updated content and extra content added by other superusers which may require updates and approvals. On their profile page they can see the posts they have created and the orders they have placed themselves.

For regular users, there is content to view and updates regarding the guild and items to purchase. Email confirmations can be received by the user to confirm their email address when registering and email confirmation for orders when they place an order.

Upon subsequent visits to the site, they can see any updated content and new items added to the shop. Their profiles will be updated with orders they have placed previously and can view the order confirmation for those orders.

## Features

I wanted the design and colour scheme to look basic but sci-fi-esque. Dark green for the background allows me to add a few light colours for the
